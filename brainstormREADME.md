## Objects
* What objects will you need?
  * Leader board object to hold Players & their scores
    * Player 1 & Player 2 that contain their score total & turn total
* What key-value pairs will each object need to contain in order for the game to work?
  *  * Leader Board { players: { Player {score total, turn total} } }
  * Player {score total, turn total}

## Functions
* What functions?
  * Roll di function (returns random number from 1-6)
  * Tally function â€“ takes rollDi() value as input and returns turn total
    * if roll === 1, then returns a turn total of 0
  * Hold function - takes as input the current turn total & passes it to update player's score total
  * Switch turn function, tells which score to update
    * currentPlayer
  * checkWinner function - takes both players' scores and outputs winner
    * if player's score >= 100, they won!
